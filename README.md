# Titanic Survival Prediction

📊 **Project Type:** Machine Learning Classification (Tutorial / Benchmark Project)  
📅 **Original work completed:** October – December 2024  
📤 **Repository updated & published:** February 2026  
📦 **Dataset:** Kaggle – Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster  

---

## 🚢 Overview

This repository contains an IPython Notebook tutorial for the Kaggle competition  
**“Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster”**.

The project demonstrates a complete, beginner-to-intermediate **end-to-end data analysis and machine learning workflow** using Python and common PyData libraries. It is intended as a **learning and reference project** for those interested in:

- Data analytics  
- Applied machine learning  
- Kaggle-style data science workflows  

The core analysis was completed in **late 2024** and later **cleaned, documented, and published in February 2026** as part of my GitHub portfolio.
