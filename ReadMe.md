## 🚢 Project Overview

This repository contains an IPython / Jupyter Notebook–based machine learning analysis for the Kaggle competition  
**“Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.”**

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end **data analytics and machine learning workflow** using Python and standard PyData libraries. It is designed as a **learning and reference project** for individuals interested in:

- Data analytics  
- Applied machine learning  
- Kaggle-style data science competitions  

The core analysis and implementation were completed in **late 2024**.  
In **February 2026**, the project was cleaned, documented, and published on GitHub as part of a professional portfolio.
